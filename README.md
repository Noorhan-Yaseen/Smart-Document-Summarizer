# Smart-Document-Summarizer

This project is a Smart Document Summarizer built using Flask (a Python web framework) and the BART Large CNN model. The application takes text documents (or any large content) and generates concise summaries to aid in quicker understanding and analysis of documents.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload text-based documents for summarization.
- **Smart Summarization**: Utilizes the BART Large CNN model to generate summaries of the documents.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask to provide an easy-to-use interface for document submission and viewing summaries.
- **Text Input Option**: Allows users to directly paste large text content for summarization.
- **Multiple Formats Support**: Currently supports PDF and DOCX formats for document upload.
 - **Multi-Document Summarization**: Ability to process and summarize multiple documents at once.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-document-summarizer.git
    cd smart-document-summarizer
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file should include necessary libraries like:
    - Flask
    - requests
    - pdfminer.six
    - python-docx
    - flask-cors
    - transformers

4. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    The app will be accessible on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

### Web Interface
Once the app is running:
1. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Upload a text document (or paste large content) for summarization.
3. View the summary generated by the BART Large CNN model.

**Example**:
- Upload a document: `project_report.pdf`
- The app will process the document and display a summarized version in the output area.

### Text Input Option
Alternatively, you can paste raw text directly into a provided text area, and the app will generate a summary from it.

## Model Details

This application uses the **BART Large CNN** model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. It is a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model designed for tasks like document summarization. The model is optimized for handling long input sequences and generating meaningful, concise summaries.

## Credits

- **Flask**: For building the web application.
- **Hugging Face**: For providing the pre-trained BART Large CNN model.
- **PyTorch**: For deep learning framework.
- **Transformers**: For the model's easy integration with Python.
